# Bibliograpyh Processing
Python script for converting exported bib files from Mendeley into other formats and for some light processing.

## Rationale
I needed a program for bringing bibtex files exported from Mendeley into Excel|R for further processing as Mendeley is somewhat limited in how it can process bibliography entries.
This script does what I need it to.
Please adapt according to your own needs.

## Dependencies
- [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/py-modindex.html): Only needed if doing some processing with the bibliography entries
