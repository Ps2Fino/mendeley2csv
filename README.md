# Mendeley 2 CSV
Python script for converting exported bib files from Mendeley into CSV.

## Rationale
I needed a program for bringing bibtex files exported from Mendeley into Excel|R for further processing as Mendeley is somewhat limited in how it can process bibliography entries.
This script does what I need it to.
Please adapt according to your own needs.
