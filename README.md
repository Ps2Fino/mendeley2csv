# Bibliography Processing
Python script for converting exported bib files from Mendeley into other formats and for some light processing.

## Rationale
I needed a program for bringing bibtex files exported from Mendeley|Zotero into Excel|R for further processing as Mendeley is somewhat limited in how it can process bibliography entries.
This script does what I need it to.
Please adapt according to your own needs.

If anything, the script is useful for compressing bibliographies: the output csv file will be smaller than the input bibtex file for example.

<!-- - [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/py-modindex.html): Only needed if doing some processing with the bibliography entries -->
